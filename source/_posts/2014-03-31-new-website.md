You're looking at the brand-new website for sabre/dav. Up until now sabre/dav
never had a proper website, and we've always just hosted from Google Code.

As Google slowly started to lose interested in code hosting, we migrated more
and more features to GitHub. The biggest thing left: the wiki. So what once
started as a place to host the new wiki, turned into a brand-new design, by
[our][1] very own Martin Kaniut, who's also responsible for the [fruux][1]
design.

We hope you like it, but since it's such a step up from Google Code, we're
confident you probably will ;). If you're running into any bugs, definitely
[let us know][2]. Want to contribute to the wiki? The entire site is open source, so
[take a look][3] at some of the existing pages and get cracking!
