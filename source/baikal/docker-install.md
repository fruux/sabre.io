Although we do not provide an official Baikal Docker image there is a community
maintained image __[ckulka/baikal][1]__ available on DockerHub.

It works well with Let's Encrypt and Traefik to provide secure installations.

For details and installation instructions see __[ckulka/baikal-docker][2]__ on
GitHub.
